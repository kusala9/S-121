Current version of schema (v4.0). Originally this was "Collection 3.9" - now official 4.0 schema.  All schema docs in the root of the deliverables folder and on the schema wiki page.

This version of the schema is also the one reflected in the current IHO S-121 page www.s-121.com/schemas/v4.0/S121.xsd

An S-100 XML Feature Catalogue S-121_FC_1.0.0draft_4_0 which is the S-100 conceptual equivalent of the 4.0 S121.xsd file has been posted by Teledyne Caris as it was used in the Caris tesbed.  A more human readable and browse-able html version of the FC is also here. There may still be some relationship and other minor updates needed but it seems to work well with the latest gml datasets posted using the 4.0 xsd.
